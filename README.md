CyGym is a cybersecurity encounter simulator leveraging the OpenAI Gym framework for game-theoretic reinforcement learning research in network defense. It features realistic network topologies, a broad array of vulnerabilities and exploits including zero-day attacks, and diverse defensive mechanisms. It introduces a PSRO-style equilibrium computation framework for strategic agent interactions, and a novel zero-day exploit modeling approach. Its realism and analytic power are demonstrated via deployment against the Volt Typhoon APT scenario.

            NASimEmu is a framework for training deep RL agents in offensive penetration-testing scenarios. It includes both a simulator and an emulator so that a simulation-trained agent can be seamlessly deployed in emulation. Additionally, it includes a random generator that can create scenario instances varying in network configuration and size while fixing certain features, such as exploits and privilege escalations. Furthermore, agents can be trained and tested in multiple scenarios simultaneously.<br/><br/>

            CyGIL is an experimental testbed of an emulated RL training environment for network cyber operations. CyGIL uses a stateless environment architecture and incorporates the MITRE ATT&CK framework to establish a high fidelity training environment, while presenting a sufficiently abstracted interface to enable RL training. Its comprehensive action space and flexible game design allow the agent training to focus on particular advanced persistent threat (APT) profiles, and to incorporate a broad range of potential threats and vulnerabilities. By striking a balance between fidelity and simplicity, it aims to leverage state of the art RL algorithms for application to real-world cyber defence. <br/><br/>
